In addition to defining the types of objects, we can also use interfaces to type functions, 
their return values, and their arguments. For example, we can do something like this.

TypeScript has native support for the class keyword that was implemented in ES2015.
 You can define a class as well as its fields and methods like this.

// Optional Properties
// color?: string

// Read Only Properties
//In TypeScript, we can use the readonly keyword with interfaces to mark a property as readonly.
//This means that the target property canâ€™t be written to during type-checking although its behavior doesnâ€™t change during runtime.

// Example: readonly name: string;

// discriminating unions
interface Circle {
  kind: 'circle';
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: 'square';
  sideLength: number;

function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
  if (shape.kind === 'circle') {
    // We know it's a Circle interface here
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
  }

  // We know it's a Square interface here
  return shape.sideLength ** 2;
}

const circle: Shape = { kind: 'circle', radius: 5 };

console.log(getArea(circle)); // Output: 78.53981633974483
